GoMalloc
-----------

Its a homework assignment to design our own personal
malloc() and free() method in C.

The `malloc-assignment.pdf` have detail plan
for this assignment.

Notes
-------
* The file to modify and handing in is `mm.c`.
* The `mdriver.c` program is a driver program that will
evaluate the correctness and performance of the program.
* Use the command `make` to generate the driver code and run
it command `./mdriver -V` where `-V` flag displays helpful
summary information. While `./mdriver -lV` also report the performance
of the dynammic memory management routines from standard C library(glibc)
